		<h2>Youtube has a distraction</h2>
        <p>Many people come to youtube to watch videos from an exact channel, or even one video.
        However, when one is watching a video, he sees "recommendations" on the right and clicks on them, and thus
        starts roaming from one video to another, forgetting the purpose of going to Youtube in the first place.
        <br>
        Besides people afromentioned, there are more out there who open Youtube just after booting a computer without
        even a rigorous reason to do so.
        They may perceive "recommendations" as a good thing, because otherwise they would have nothing to do.
