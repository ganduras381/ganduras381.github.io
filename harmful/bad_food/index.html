		<h2>Bad food is bad</h2>
        <h3>What food to eat</h3>
        <p>Local foods are best suited for the local man. If you hail from western Russia, eat food native
        to western Russia.
        You could grow them by yourself without much effort.
        <br>
        Eat raw food when possible. Cooked food loses some of its nutritional value. In most contexts, meat should be cooked.
        <h3>Natural Flavor</h3>
        Stop throwing lots of seasonings and pouring sauces into your food! If you do that, you lose the natural flavor of the food and replace it with
        too pleasant one, which leads to excecsive consumption. It may seem that without such additives the food has no flavor, which is
        not true. Try to eat foods with only a tiny pinch of salt
        instead of much salt for a couple of days. You will experience that the rice, the noodles, the potatoes, or whatever, <i>has</i> its own
        good flavor! For the same reason, sugary foods such as all sorts of confectionery, soft drinks are all harmful: they have pleasant flavor
        but no nutritional value.
