		<h2>Not carrying weapons is dangerous for your life</h2>
        Most of us live and interact with people they don't know and have no natural (biological) relation (in cities).
        The men who walk on the streets with me are not my siblings or parents. I can never expect my kinsmen to
        threaten me physically. However, I can expect a stranger to rob or kill me. This is why crime happens.
        <br>
        Many governments restrict people to carry weapons. This happens because 1) they want to make people more dependent
        on authorities in relation to defense from dangerous situations (police) and 2) make them less prone to violence
        and thus more weak and obedient. It seems like
        people have accepted this restriction and now they feel nervous when they see a man with a knife hanging on his belt and
        perceive all weapons as relating to criminals. Those people are unable to protect themselves and contempt those who do so.
        <br>
        In most countries the right for self-defence does not really exist. For example, if someone has broken into my house and I
        killed him with a firearm, most likely, I will be spending my time in prison for some years. In this situation, the
        authorities may tell that I defended myself "too much".
        <br>
        Sometimes spending the time in prison is better that being dead.
        <h3>Alternatives</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Carry whatever weapons your government allows you to (for knives, use fixed blades, not folding)</li>
            <li>Learn to fight with the weapons you carry and unarmed. There are some good books for that on
                <a href="http://www.ganduras.tk/books/">this page</a></li>
        </ul>
