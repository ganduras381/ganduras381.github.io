		<h2>Freedom from harmful technology</h2>
		<p>Modern technology, contrarily to popular belief, makes us only weaker and dumber. 
		I use the word 'us' as individual human beings, or <i>you</i>. A good example 
		of this are elevators in multi-storey buildings. Have I become too weak to 
		use the stairs with my foot? What if the elevator is broken
		and I live on 26-th floor?
		<br>
		"Is my memory so weak that I can't remember ten items to buy in the store?" If 
		the answer is yes, you need a shopping list.
		<br>
		Technology breaks very often, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence">
			sometimes because the creator wants them to</a>. When it happens, people tend and 
		encouraged (by companies) to call somebody to do the repair for them 
		instead of repairing by themselves, thus they are dependent on the 
		guy who repairs (often called an "expert"). You also need to pay the 
		"expert" (if you don't, his service is included in the price of the item),
		forcing you to work on the "job" more, if you are not working enough 
		already. Disability to repair one's own piece of technology makes him dependent 
		even more.
