        Fortunately, my mom will buy me a new one if I ask her thoroughly. I also
        need a second monitor so I can chat on social network while playing gamez!"

        <p>Constant desire for the "better" items hinders the man from doing the right
        thing. Instead, the man should settle with the things he has already and improve
        <i>himself</i>, not the physical items surrounding him.

        <blockquote>The body is to everyone the proper measure of its possessions,
            as the foot is of the shoe. If, therefore, you stop at this, you will
            keep the measure; but if you move beyond it; you must necessarily be
            carried forward, as down a precipice; as in the case of a shoe, if you
            go beyond its fitness to the foot, it comes first to be glided, then purple,
            and then studded with jewels. For to that which once exceeds the fit measure
            there is no bound.
        <br>
        &mdash; Epictetus, Enchiridion

        <blockquote>
        Fancy not to thyself things future, as though they were present
        but of those that are present, take some aside, that thou takest most benefit
        of, and consider of them particularly, how wonderfully thou wouldst want
        them, if they were not present. But take heed withal, lest that whilst thou
        dust settle thy contentment in things present, thou grow in time so to
        overprize them, as that the want of them (whensoever it shall so fall out)
        should be a trouble and a vexation unto thee. Wind up thyself into thyself.
        Such is the nature of thy reasonable commanding part, as that if it exercise
        justice, and have by that means tranquillity within itself, it doth rest fully.
        <br>
        &mdash; Marcus Aurelius, Meditations (seventh book, paragraph XX)
