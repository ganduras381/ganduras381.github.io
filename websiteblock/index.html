		<h2>How do you block websites for degenerates</h2>
        Want to get rid of porn, social media, ads and other junk? You can block all of that with a simple text file present on all operating systems.
        Your computer wouldn't be able to connect to the websites in the list. Google is blocked for good. It is a company
        which spies on its users. Use DuckDuckGo or startpage or whatever (not Bing, which is owned by another BIG company)
        <br>
        <strong>All websites in the list are junk, no exceptions. Add new sites if you want</strong>
        <br>
        <strong>Further instructions are in the file itself.</strong>
